## README

### Context
This repository is part of learning Kotlin language to backend.
The lessons and exercises are from an Udemy course named "Build fully functional, robust and efficient applications with Spring Boot and the Kotlin programming language" from Matt Greencroft.
It's a 8 hours course with 20 chapters and 21 sections.

I've been also reading [the official documentation for Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html).
